# Codex Handoff Summary

Date: 2025-09-12 13:34:51 UTC  
Project: teller_clean (Express API + Public Dashboard)  
Context: Trimmed record of what Codex has done so far.

---

## 1. Files Created / Modified
- teller_clean/server.js → Minimal Express + pg API, static hosting from public/
- teller_clean/package.json → Node 18+ app config with express/pg and start script
- teller_clean/public/index.html → Display-only dashboard; fetches /dashboard/balances
- teller_clean/public/td_balance_demo.html → Teller Connect + refresh + TD balance display
- teller_clean/render.yaml → Render Web Service + Postgres blueprint; env wiring; health check
- teller_clean/td_balance_demo.html → Initial standalone demo (now duplicated; recommend removal)

## 2. Key Decisions
- Same-origin serving: host frontend via Express static public/ to avoid CORS and simplify fetches.
- Separation of concerns: keep Teller Connect on a dedicated demo page; dashboard remains display-only.
- Simplicity-first backend: Node + Express + pg, single account_balance table, no ORM/workers.
- Render-first deployment: include render.yaml to stand up Web Service + Postgres quickly.

## 3. Tasks Completed
- Implemented API routes: POST /api/refresh (upsert balances), GET /dashboard/balances, GET /api/health.
- Created public dashboard and demo; demo fixed to send Bearer token and show clear error/empty states.
- Added render.yaml to provision service + database and wire DATABASE_URL automatically.

## 4. Outstanding / Recommended
- Remove duplicate: delete root teller_clean/td_balance_demo.html to prevent file:// or cross-origin confusion.
- Make DB SSL conditional: only enable ssl rejectUnauthorized:false for Render; allow local non-TLS Postgres.
- Port real dashboard: replace public/index.html with your full llc_dashboard_index.html and wire existing IDs.
- TD detection: replace name-contains “td” heuristic with institution-based selection when available.
- Optional CORS: if you ever serve frontend separately, add CORS to the API and use absolute API URLs.
- Render DB URL: consider using internalConnectionString in render.yaml if you prefer Render’s internal network.

## 5. Next Steps
- Local run: set DATABASE_URL, npm install, npm start; visit http://localhost:3000/td_balance_demo.html to connect and verify data; then confirm http://localhost:3000/ (dashboard) shows balances.
- Deploy on Render: use render.yaml (CLI or dashboard) to create the Web Service + Postgres; verify /api/health, then exercise demo and dashboard.
- Dashboard port: copy your actual llc_dashboard_index.html into public/index.html and wire its IDs to /dashboard/balances as needed.
- Optional job: add a Render Cron to POST /api/refresh daily (with a suitable token strategy) for scheduled refreshes.
